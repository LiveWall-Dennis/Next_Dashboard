Next.js

- Next.js can serve static assets, like images, under the top-level /public folder. Files inside /public can be referenced in your application.
- The <Image> Component is an extension of the HTML <img> tag, and comes with automatic image optimization, such as:
    - Preventing layout shift automatically when images are loading.
    - Resizing images to avoid shipping large images to devices with a smaller viewport.
    - Lazy loading images by default (images load as they enter the viewport).
    - Serving images in modern formats, like WebP and AVIF, when the browser supports it.


          <Image 
            src="/hero-desktop.png"
            width={1000}
            height={760}
            className='hidden md:block'
            alt="Hero Image"
          />

          width and height are original width and height of images, scales dynamicly, md: = viewport query
